#Web Terminal Extension
---

Web Terminal Project

A web-based terminal extension for executing GitHub CLI, Firebase CLI, and Vercel CLI commands remotely, without relying on localhost. This terminal allows users to manage deployments and repositories directly from a web interface.


---

Features

Web-based Terminal – Run CLI commands directly in the browser.

Multi-CLI Support – Supports GitHub CLI, Firebase CLI, and Vercel CLI.

Containerized Execution – CLI commands run in Docker containers for isolation.

Real-time Command Execution – Live feedback through WebSockets.

OAuth Authentication – Secure login using GitHub, Firebase, or Vercel.

Multi-user Support – Session-based command tracking.

Scalable – Backend deployable via Firebase Functions, frontend on Vercel.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, xterm.js

Backend: Node.js (Express), Firebase Functions

Containerization: Docker (CLI environment)

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Firebase (Backend)

cd web-terminal

2. Run the Setup Script



chmod +x setup-web-terminal.sh
./setup-web-terminal.sh


---

Deployment

Frontend: Deployed on Vercel

Backend: Deployed via Firebase Functions

CLI Container: Docker image with GitHub, Vercel, and Firebase CLI tools

Usage

1. Access the terminal at the Vercel URL.


2. Log in using OAuth (GitHub, Firebase, or Vercel).


3. Execute CLI commands for GitHub, Firebase, and Vercel directly in the web terminal.




---

Security

Sandboxing – Commands run in isolated Docker containers.

OAuth Authentication – Secure login with GitHub, Firebase, or Vercel.

Rate Limiting – Prevent command spamming.

Logging – All commands are logged for tracking and debugging.



---
